## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview
In this project I cloned a version of an Instagram profile page focusing on CSS layout and styling. I apply CSS styling to an HTML structure to achieve a design resembling an Instagram profile, I demonstrated proficiency in CSS layout techniques, included flexbox and grid, this responce webpage adapts to different  screen sizes and it cohesive user interface.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery
- CSS layout: I actually enjoyed this part as much as it was a strugle to actually to create visually appealing insta layouts. What trully helped was to open the Insta app and create those layouts according.
- Styling Element: CSS styling helped me to creating visually appealing, consistent, and responsive to my Insta webpage.
-Responsive Design: I used this section for the Insta webpage to actually respond on different screens.


#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: This section was actually challenging, cause I had to include all HTML sections and ensure they respond when the screen changes.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: This was part wow, I dont know why I'm still struggling, well I always confuse the focus part. 

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I want to explore on responsive design using media queries, making adjustments for smaller screens and fully understand them.
- **Code Optimization**: Well my code so far I thing I'm improving every day, all I need to is learn to not forget commenting out what is unneccessary.
- **Creative Design Choices**: I thing I'm creative just that I need to decide fast on what to use in my design.

#### Overall Learning Experience
Well what I learn is to complete a project was started but not finished, and I feel like is a great feeling we were given clear instrutions on what to use for the outcomes of the project rather than coming uo with your own ideas.
